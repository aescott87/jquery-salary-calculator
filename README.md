# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_ 

This application allows the user to input employee data (including first and last name, employee ID number, job title, and annual salary), and list this data on the page. Inputting this data will also show how each employee salary contributes to a company's monthly budget and determine if the monthly budget has been exceeded.

### Prerequisites

There is no prerequisite software to install, however jQuery and Bootstrap were utilized and can be downloaded below:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Installation

1. Create and source your html, script, and css files,
2. The html and script files contain the basic framework and functions required to run the application. As mentioned previously, you will want to have [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/) downloaded and sourced in your html file to be able to run the application properly. Note that the maximum monthly budget (listed as the variable maxMonthlyBudget at the top of the script file) is currently set at $20,000, so you will need to change the amount if your monthly budget is higher or lower, 
3. Right click on your html file and select, "Open in browser" and a window will be opened for you.

## Usage

1. Enter employee data in the designated inputs, and click "Submit".
2. Repeat step 1 for as many employees as needed.
3. If you want to remove an employee from the list, click on the "Delete" button on the row in which the employee is listed.
4. The monthly budget will adjust at the top of the screen as employees are added and removed. Once your maximum monthly budget has been reached, the number will then show with a red background.
